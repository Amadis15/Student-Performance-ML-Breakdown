This project applies a Random Forest regression model to predict student academic performance using reading, writing, and math scores. I performed data cleaning and validation, engineered a composite Final_Score feature by averaging subject scores, and split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. The model demonstrated strong generalization, with minimal difference between training and testing Mean Squared Error (MSE). The trained model was saved using joblib for reuse and potential deployment. This project highlights applied regression modeling, feature engineering, and model evaluation using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
