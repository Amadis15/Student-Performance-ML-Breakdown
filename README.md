This project predicts student performance based on their reading, writing, and math scores using a Random Forest Regression model. In order to create a new Final_Score feature that averages the scores of all three subjects, I first cleaned the dataset and looked for duplicates or missing values. The Random Forest achieved strong generalization with only a slight difference between training and testing error, according to my Mean Squared Error (MSE) comparison of the model performance after dividing the data into training and testing sets. After that, Joblib was used to save the model for deployment. This project showcases useful regression modeling, data preprocessing, and assessment abilities with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
